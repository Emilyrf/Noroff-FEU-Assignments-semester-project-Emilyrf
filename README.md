## Briefing :memo:
An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants a website that is informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself. The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices.

- The site must be have a design that appeals to the target audience.
- The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
- Compositional principles, typography, and color schemes must be considered.
- Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
- The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
- The site should download quickly, and not be overly "heavy". Images should not be over 200kb.
- The site should take WCAG principles into consideration, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation, and color usage.
- The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on a variety of devices.
- The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of meta tags and alt text).
- The GitHub repo for the project should be set to private. You do not need to submit this with your project.
